<h3> big questions</h3>

How does the human mind learn and represent knowledge? How does it search for information within its vast mental lexicon and decide which information is most relevant in a given context? What kinds of mechanisms underlie these complex phenomena? In this lab, we tackle these questions by conducting experimental investigations, building and evaluating computational models, and integrating perspectives from three core branches of cognitive science - psychology, artifical intelligence, and linguistics.

<strong><span style="color:#508AB0">Bowdoin students</span></strong>: If you are interested in working on any of the projects below, or have a project in mind that aligns with the core questions motivating the lexicon lab, please <a href ="mailto:kumaraa@iu.edu">email</a> Abhilasha with your availability during fall/spring 2022. <br>

We are taking part in a <a href ="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/replication">Registered Replication</a> project! This project is a large-scale replication of the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_inhibition#%22Think/no-think%22_paradigm_and_intentional_inhibition">Think/No-Think paradigm</a>, widely used to study the suppression of unwanted memories. The lexicon lab will be contributing one complete dataset (<i>N</i> = 48) to this replication effort by Spring 2023. Undergraduate students looking for a concrete research experience are encouraged to get in touch!<br> </li>

<img src="/images/research/fluency.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%" id="right"/><br> 
If asked to come up with all the animals you know, most people can come with a decent number, and this list is often clustered by sub-categories of animals, such as pets, farm animals, etc. How does this generation process work? This line of research investigates how search occurs in the fluency task, and how it may break down when different aspects of cognition are impaired.<br></li>

Why do words sometimes feel as if they're on the tip of our tongues? Why are some words harder to remember than others? Do the sound and meaning of words have different roles in remembering and forgetting? In this work, we investigate the influence of combined phonological and semantic information on lexical retrieval using a word definition trivia task (e.g., What is the capital of Finland?). We also examine how semantics and phonology interact during memory recall of memory recall of short lists of word pairs. We find interesting interactions between these two sources of information across different tasks and are continuing to investigate memory patterns during free recall. <br></li>

Semantic memory is fundamental to nearly everything we do. In this line of work, we investigate how individuals utilize their knowledge about concepts to flexibly perform communicative tasks. We employ rich experimental paradigms such as cooperative language games (think Codenames!) and model how underlying semantic knowledge is searched and retrieved to ultimately communicate with partners. <br></li>

In this work, we explore when and how people decide to offer help, and the role of language in mediating cooperative tasks.<br></li>
