<p>We are interested in how humans learn the meaning of concepts and how they retrieve and communicate information from their mental lexicon. We use experimental research methods, computational modeling, and psychological theory to answer questions about language and cognition. Check out our <a href="https://lexicon-lab.github.io/research/">research</a> or <a href="https://lexicon-lab.github.io/publications/">publications</a> page to know more about our work. </p>
