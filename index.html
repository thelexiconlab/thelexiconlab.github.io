<p class = "postimage">We are interested in how humans learn the meaning of words, how they communicate as social agents, and how search unfolds within the mental lexicon. We use experimental research methods, computational modeling, and psychological theory to study language and higher-order cognition.</p> 
<p class = "postimage">Our research is funded by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a>. Check out our <a href="https://thelexiconlab.github.io/research/">research</a> or <a href="https://thelexiconlab.github.io/publications/">publications</a> page to know more about our work. </p>
